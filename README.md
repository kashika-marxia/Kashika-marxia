##Hi there this is kashika
# 🍝 Coding Over Cooking 👩‍💻

Welcome to **Coding Over Cooking**, where bugs are better than burnt toast and a perfect line of code beats a perfect dish any day.

## 🚀 About Me

Hi! I'm someone who’d rather debug than deep-fry.  
This is my little corner of GitHub, where I mix creativity with code and serve it fresh—no oven needed.

I specialize in:
- 🐍 **Python Programming** – From scripts to full-blown applications  
- 🖼️ **Presentations** – Visually clear, compelling, and impactful slides  
- 🗣️ **Communication Skills** – Explaining complex ideas simply & effectively

## 💡 What You’ll Find Here

- 🔧 Mini projects & Python tools  
- 📊 Presentation templates & automation  
- 💬 Scripts that talk, bots that listen  
- ✨ Clean, well-commented code (most of the time 😅)

## 🍳 Why “Coding Over Cooking”?

Because:
- My terminal doesn't overheat like a stove  
- Python errors are easier to fix than undercooked pasta  
- And Ctrl+Z works way better than scraping burnt rice

## 📫 Let’s Connect

If you're into code that speaks, slides that wow, or just want to talk about cool ideas—feel free to connect!

**Thanks for stopping by!**
